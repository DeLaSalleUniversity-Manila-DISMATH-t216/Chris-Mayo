#DISCRETE MATHEMATICS PORTFOLIO



# Week 1
- Introduction to Discrete Mathematics ( DISMATH ) which is understanding more about the knowledge closer to the machines ( the commands and the Binary: 0 and 1 )
- I've learned that PROPOSITION is a statement that is "True" or "False" but not both






# Week 2 ( 1st meeting; 1/25 )

- I've learned about the Logical Connectives and its truth tables

| **LOGICAL SYMBOL** | **LOGICAL OPERATOR** | **SIMPLE TERM** | **FORMULA** |   **LOGICAL EQUATION**     |
|:------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:----------------------------:|
| ¬  |Negation|not|val(¬p)= 1 - val(p)|¬p|
|^|Conjunction|and|val (p ^ q) = min(val(p), val(q))|p^q|
| v |Disjunction| or | val(p  v q) = max(val(p), val(q))|p v q|
|⊕ |Exclusive Disjunction| xor | if val(p) not equal val(q) = 1 ,otherwise 0 | p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |

- Conjunction ( ^ ) is the minimum value; Disjunction ( v ) is the maximum value; Exclusive or ( ⊕ ) ≡ (p  v q) v ( ¬p  ¬q)



# Week 2 ( 2nd Meeting; 1/27 )

| **LOGICAL SYMBOL** | **LOGICAL OPERATOR** | **SIMPLE TERM** | **FORMULA** |   **LOGICAL EQUATION**     |
  |:------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:----------------------------:|
  | → | Conditional | if then | if val(p) ≤ val(q) = 1, otherwise 0| p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
  |↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1, otherwise 0 | p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
  
  
- Conditional ( → ) when q is True = True, and when p is false = True; Biconditional is NEGATED XOR ¬(p ⊕ q) ≡ p ↔ q

- I've also learned about the Logic Laws and Logical Equivalences ( Implication Equivalence: p → q = ¬p v q )
- When proving it is important to develop a series of logical equivalences


 


# Week 3 ( 1st Meeting; 2/1 )

- I've learned about Converse, Inverse and Contrapositive **FROM p → q**; **Converse** is **q → p**; **Inverse** is **¬p → ¬q**; **Contraposition** is the **negation of Converse** **¬q → ¬p**

- Tautology = Always true in all conditions

- Quantifiers ( Existential and Universal ) **Existential** is easy to prove, hard to disprove; when at least one domain is True, it can be true ; while **Universal** is hard to prove, easy to disprove in which all conditions must be true to consider it Universally true
